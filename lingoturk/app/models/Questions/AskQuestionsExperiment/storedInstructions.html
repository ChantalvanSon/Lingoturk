<h3> Instructions </h3>
In this experiment, you are asked to formulate questions about everyday situations, for example <i>baking a cake</i> or <i>going to a restaurant</i>. We ask you to imagine you told a story about a certain situation to a child, e.g. about a person that visited a restaurant. You want to test if it understood everything correctly, so you'll ask questions about the situation, such as:
<ul>
    <li>Who brought the food?</li>
    <li>Where were they seated?</li>
    <li>What did they order?</li>
</ul>
<br/>
You will be asked to formulate 15 questions for each situation. To guide you, we will give you a template with possible question types. You have to write at least 3 questions for every type. For the remaining 6 questions, you can ask any question that sounds reasonable to you to ask for this situation.
<br/><br/>
There are 3 main rules for formulating questions:
<br/>
<ol>
    <li> Please do not formulate the same question again with different words, every question should
        be unique.</li>
    <li> Try to ask about central, relevant aspects of the situation and anything that could plausibly
        have happened before or after the situation. As an example in the templates below, you can assume that they came to the restaurant by car or bus and that they ordered a certain type of food, e.g. a salad or a sirloin steak.</li>
    <li> Formulate only questions that can be answered with a couple of words, i.e. no complex explanation or elaboration should be required.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Example:</h3>
<h4>Imagine you told a child a story about <strong>a person visiting a restaurant</strong>. Try to find out if it understood everything correctly and ask questions!</h4>
<p>
<h4>Type 1: Time</h4>
</p>
Asking for when something happened:
<ol>
    <li>When did they order a dessert?</li>
    <li>When did they pay?</li>
</ol>
Asking for durations/time spans:
<ol>
    <li>How long did they wait?</li>
</ol>

<p>
<h4>Type 2: Content</h4>
</p>
Asking about persons who were involved in the situation:
<ol>
    <li>Who cooked the food?</li>
    <li>Who showed them their seat?</li>
</ol>
Asking for locations:
<ol>
    <li>Where is the restaurant?</li>
    <li>Where did they sit?</li>
</ol>
Asking for other content details of the situation:
<ol>
    <li>What did they order?</li>
    <li>What type of wine did they drink??</li>
</ol>

<p>
<h4>Type 3: Reasoning/Manner</h4>
</p>
Asking how questions:
<ol>
    <li>How did the food taste?</li>
    <li>How did they pay?</li>
</ol>
Asking for why something happened:
<ol>
    <li>Why did they order the vegetarian option?</li>
    <li>Why did they ask for a reservation?</li>
</ol>

<p><font color="red"><h4>Bad examples:</h4></font></p>
<ol>
    <li>Who was the cook’s sister? - This is not related to visiting a restaurant!</li>
    <li>What color were the plates? - This is a detail that is not relevant to the visit.</li>
    <li>Why did they visit the museum before going to the restaurant? - It’s not plausible that this happened during or before the situation.</li>
    <li> Describe the restaurant! - The question is very unspecific, so the answer would have to be very long.</li>
</ol>
