<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><span lang="en-US">Thank you for participating in this experiment!</span></p>
<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><span lang="en-US">For this test, you will be presented with series of sentences. You will have to judge whether these sentences are acceptable or not. After judging the acceptability of 2 or more sentences, you will be asked to write down in the given slots the last word of the sentences, but not the last word of the first sentence! So if you have judged the acceptability of 2 sentences, you will only have to write down the final word of the second sentence. You will have to do this for 25 series of sentences. This test will take approximately 30 minutes.</span></p>
<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><span lang="en-US">If possible, write down the words in the correct order in which you saw them; so first the final word of sentence 2, then the final word of sentence 3, etc (but not the final word of the first sentence!). If you cannot remember all of the words in the order in which you saw them, please write down whatever words you can remember.</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><span lang="en-US">Please try to perform the acceptability task very accurately, and then perform as well as you can on the word memory task. Both tasks are important for this test, so please do not focus only on one of the two tasks.</span></p>
