<p>Dear participant,</p>

<p>For this experiment you will be asked to read 20 passages of text and indicate the logical link between the black-printed elements of the passages. Below you can see an example of what each passage will look like:</p>

<img style="display:block;margin: 20px auto" src="/assets/images/Experiments/NewDiscourseConnectivesExperiment/exampleScreenShot.PNG"></img>

<p>The parts in grey provide the background for the sentences in black, which have a logical connection between them. The double slash (//) before the green box indicates that there can be some kind of marker there; i.e., a full stop (.), comma (,) or colon (;). You can interpret the double slash in any way you want.</p>

<p>Your task will be to "drag and drop" a connecting phrase from the list of candidate phrases to the green box in the text. Please choose the linking phrase that best reflects the meaning of the connection between the black sentences. For example, in the passage above, "because" would fit better than the phrase "more specifically".</p>

<p>The passages you will read for this study are more complicated than the example above. They come from newspapers published between 1980-1995. Below you see an example of such a passage.</p>

<p>There might be passages for which you would normally not use a linking phrase because it sounds more fluent or coherent without a linking phrase. Please try to choose one anyway, even if the resulting phrase sounds "awkward".</p>

<p>If you feel that two of the linking phrases both fit well in the text, you can click "add another connective", and drag and drop another linking phrase.</p>
<p>If you feel that none of the predefined linking phrases fit, you can click "none of these" and type the linking phrase that you think should be added.</p>

<p>There are a few catch trials in this experiment: items for which we are sure that you will get the right connective. We will evaluate your performance on these items as well.</p>

<p>There are multiple studies with the name "Linking phrases" on Prolific. You are allowed to participate once in each study with this name.</p>
