<ul style="padding-left:17px;padding-right:5px">
    <li>This study consists of 24 sentences describing events. Your task is to read the sentences, and then <b>rate how likely you think the event is</b>.  </li>

    <li>Please treat each event separately -- do not try to tie the events together into a longer story.</li>

    <li>Do not go back and revise earlier answers.<strong> Please note: if you try to go back in the browser, all your answers will be lost!</strong></li><br/>

    <li>Below you will find an example of the task: <br/>

        <label style="margin-top:10px" for="example1">Example 1:</label> <pre id="example2">
<center>How likely is it that Becca went on a hike on her day off?</center>
<strong>Possible answer</strong>: <span style="text-decoration : underline ;">This event is <b>moderately likely</b>.</span> </pre>

        <label style="margin-top:10px" for="example1">Example 2:</label> <pre id="example2">
<center>How likely is it that Alexander studied for his medical exams?</center>
<strong>Possible answer</strong>: <span style="text-decoration : underline ;">This event is <b>very likely</b>.</span> </pre>

    <li>If you're not sure how likely an event is, simply go with your intuition.  How likely do you think people <b>generally</b> are to go hiking on their days off, or to study for very important exams?</li>

</ul>
