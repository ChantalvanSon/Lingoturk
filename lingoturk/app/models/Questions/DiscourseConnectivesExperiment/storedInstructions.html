<p>Take a look at the two sentences below. They have a logical connection between them that can be expressed by one of the connective words in the list of connectives above the sentences. You have two tasks to perform:</p>

<p>1. Drag ONE connective into the green box (the target box) between the sentences. Choose the one that best fits the logical relation between the sentences. This will appear in the top right corner of the box. </p>

<p>The list of connectives will immediately be replaced by another list with a light orange background.  The target box will be replaced by THREE target boxes.</p>

<p>2. Now drag EACH connective word from the upper box to the relevant target box that you think is suitable to connect the two sentences by logical relations that make sense to you.</p>

<p>The meaning of the boxes: &quot;not relevant&quot; -- these connectives do not clearly logically connect the two sentences. &quot;valid connective&quot; -- these connectives represent a logical link between the two sentences &quot;can't decide&quot; -- you cannot decide whether any of these connectives represent a logical link between the sentences</p>

<p>3. When you've classified EACH of the connectives into the target boxes, press the submit button.</p>

<p>NOTE: You can change your mind at each step. To undo the connective selection in step 1, there is an X at the right corner of the target box. To undo a connective selection in step 2, just drag the connective word back into the upper box. If you press the X next to the selected connective from step 1 DURING step 2, you start over at step 1.</p>

<p>You have 10 minutes to do the task before the HIT expires.</p>
